# DespyNumPyramidGenerator

A Python-based triangle generator that not only generates sequences and certain number triangles, but also prints them out on the screen in different triangular-array like arrangements, somewhat resembling pyramids.

## Installation

This program requires the [Python 3 interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.

## Running the App

After cloning the repo, navigate to the folder using a terminal of your choice, and type in the following:

```
python src/main.py
```

Use the number keys and Enter key on your keyboard to navigate the menus and select what you want to print out and how, including orientation, the number of lines, the width of each step (not supported for famous number triangles).

Unless otherwise stated below, you can select to print between 3 to 80 lines.

All triangles printed out have a maximum width of 160 characters across the screen.

## Features

This program handles the following sequences and number triangles:

#### Basic:
* Simple (you choose which visible letter to make the pyramid out of, including punctuation, symbols, and Unicode characters)

#### Famous Sequences:
* Fibonacci 
* Triangle
* Alternating Bits

#### Number Triangles:
* Pascal's Triangle (max 26 lines)
* Euler's Triangle (max 15 lines)
* Catalan's Triangle (max 20 lines)

## Previews

#### Simple Triangle
Left Pyramid, 20 lines of the character 'K' with a step width of 3 characters.

#### Fibonacci Sequence
Silhouette pyramid, 15 lines with a step width of two characters.

## Code Formatting

This code complies with some of the guidelines of the Python PEP standards, specifically in the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) development guides.
